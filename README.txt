This project has been implemented in Linux Ubuntu, using the NetBeans development environment. It has also been successfully tested in the university's Linux Xubuntu.

In a command-line environment:
*To compile, go to: ./src/javaproject
and give the command:
	javac *.java
*To run, go to: ./src
("cd .." from the previous directory) and give the command:
	java javaproject.JavaProject

NOTE:
I operate under the assuption that a Maintenance Employee doesn't work in any Passenger Compartment and that a Cleaning Employee doesn't work
in any Equipment Compartment, even if those are inner compartments of other compartments in which they can work.
